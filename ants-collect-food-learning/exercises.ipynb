    "# AI Learns to Collect Food in Python and Pygame\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is a simulation of an ant colony in which ants must collect food and bring it back to their nest. The ant's behavior is controlled by a neural network (the DDPG agent). The state includes the ant's position, angle, and relative position to food or nest. The action is the change in the ant's angle of movement. Rewards are given based on proximity to food/nest and successful food retrieval. The neural network is implemented with three layers for both the actor (policy) and critic (value function) networks.\n",

I want to learn how reinforcement learning can be used to teach agents (ants) to perform complex tasks (like finding and retrieving food) in a simulated environment..\n",

    "# Prompt part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, So below is the breakdown of the program I want to learn how to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It must simulate an ant colony using reinforcement learning, specifically the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. \n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what the program does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Environment Setup:\n",
    "   - Creates a Pygame window to visualize the simulation.\n",
    "   - Sets up a nest and randomly placed food items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ant Behavior:\n",
    "   - Implements ants as agents that can move around the environment.\n",
    "   - Ants search for food, pick it up, and return it to the nest.\n",
    "   - Their movement is controlled by a neural network (the DDPG agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning:\n",
    "   - Uses the DDPG algorithm to train the ants' behavior.\n",
    "   - The state includes the ant's position, angle, and relative position to food or nest.\n",
    "   - The action is the change in the ant's angle of movement.\n",
    "   - Rewards are given based on proximity to food/nest and successful food retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Neural Network:\n",
    "   - Implements a neural network with three layers for both the actor (policy) and critic (value function) networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simulation Loop:\n",
    "   - Continuously updates the environment, ant positions, and food status.\n",
    "   - Renders the simulation graphically using Pygame.\n",
    "   - Allows for resetting the simulation with the 'R' key.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Learning Process:\n",
    "   - As ants interact with the environment, the DDPG agent learns to optimize their behavior.\n",
    "   - The agent can save and load its learned parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Visualization:\n",
    "   - Displays ants moving around, picking up food, and returning to the nest.\n",
    "   - Shows the nest and food items in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this program is to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be used to teach agents (ants) to perform complex tasks (finding and retrieving food) in a simulated environment. \n",
    "It combines elements of artificial intelligence, game development, and biological simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you confirm to accept the role of a teacher and to provide me with a 96 hours python + machine learning bootcamp (reinforcement learning curriculum) that will help me code it ?\n",
    "I am starting from a beginner level.\n",
    "If you confirm, please give me a recap of the rules you must follow.\n"
